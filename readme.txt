## Movie Recommendation System

## About the Project

Our project is a simple Content-Based Movie Recommendation System. We utilize movie content to recommend similar movies based on the selected one.

## About Files

Add the dataset to in the folder "dataset" under "Project\MovieRecommenderSystem\src\main\java\ec\project\dataset". You can get the dataset from the below link. After that train the algorithms, and run "MovieController.java".

## About the Dataset

We use two different datasets for recommending movies:

1. tmdb_5000_credits.csv: This dataset contains columns such as movieId, title, cast, and crew information.
2. tmdb_5000_movies.csv: This dataset includes columns like title, movieId, overview, genres, ratings, and more. We discovered this dataset on Kaggle and have attached it in the “dataset” folder. If you need more information about the dataset or cannot find it in the “dataset” folder, you can access it using the following link:
